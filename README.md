## Stored Procedure With Two Inputs for a Range of Outputs.
### Schuyler Blasy
A simple example of creating a stored procedure that allows for two input values and returns a query result with a range between those two values. This example is using MySQL and the Northwinds Database as a practice, but has practical applications for a wide range of data sets when a range of data is desired. </br></br> This particular example is using OrderID as the input fields, but is also querying ProductID, UnitPrice, and Quantity when the OrderID range is specified.</br></br> ![Stored procedure to create a range of output](https://github.com/skyblasy/SQLstoredproceduresrangeinput/blob/master/StoredProcedureSQL.JPG)
